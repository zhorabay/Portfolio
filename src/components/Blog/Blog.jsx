    <h2 className="blog-h2">From Classroom to Code: A Journey of Self-Discovery</h2>

      After graduating from school, I initially embarked on a teaching career, I inspired by the impactful guidance of my math teacher. Despite my love for mathematics and logical problem-solving, I heeded my sister’s suggestion and became an English teacher. Little did I know that this decision would set the stage for a remarkable journey of self-discovery.

      Teaching brought a mass of challenges — from managing classrooms to organizing events and motivating students. My experience at an international school in Kazakhstan sharpened my skills in problem-solving, empathy, communication, and leadership. However, life took an unexpected turn when my husband and I moved to Ukraine amid unforeseen circumstances.

      Determined to continue my professional journey, I took a bold step and founded my teaching center, focusing on preparing students for the IELTS test. Witnessing over 20 students succeed and pursue education in European universities was a rewarding chapter, but fate had more twists in store.

      The outbreak of war forced us to relocate to Romania, where I secured a position at an international school. However, my teaching stint was cut short as I embraced a new role — motherhood. During my maternity leave, I reflected on my career and realized a growing discontent with teaching.

      A friend’s suggestion to explore web development at Microverse Online School sparked my interest. The prospect of delving into the world of coding, coupled with my love for mathematics, prompted me to enroll in the Microverse Level Up course. Little did I know that this decision would redefine my career path.

      The initial challenges were daunting. The first week proved to be a stumbling block, prompting a month of introspection. I identified my weaknesses — time management, reluctance to seek help, and attempting to solve problems without fully understanding the lessons. Armed with newfound insights, I re-enrolled in the course.

      The subsequent seven months were transformative. Learning HTML and CSS posed difficulties, but my determination prevailed. The skills acquired during my teaching career — problem-solving, time management, and organizational prowess — proved invaluable. Even with a newborn in one arm, I navigated the world of coding with the other, fueled by curiosity and an unwavering desire to learn.

      The challenges were numerous, but the allure of software development overcame every obstacle. Recently, I proudly received my Full Stack Web Development certificate from Microverse — an affirmation of my resilience, dedication, and the newfound passion that fueled my journey.

      In retrospect, my evolution from a teacher to a software developer is a testament to the transformative power of self-discovery. Embracing change, learning from failures, and leveraging existing skills can pave the way for a fulfilling and unexpected career path. My journey is not just a personal triumph but a testament to the endless possibilities that arise when passion and determination intersect.
